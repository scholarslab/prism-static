      <h2>The Praxis Program</h2><hr>
      <p><a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">The Praxis Program</a> is a key mentoring and training project of the <a href="http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/"> Scholars' Lab</a> at the <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/index.html">University of Virginia Library</a>, in which six humanities graduate students  spend a year in a collaborative, hands-on, digital humanities apprenticeship. The program’s goal is to better equip knowledge workers for emerging  faculty positions and <a href="http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/&#39;">alternative academic careers</a> at a moment in which new questions can be asked and new systems built. Visit the Praxis Program  site to learn more about the program’s evolving curriculum and to hear directly from Praxis Fellows and Scholars’  Lab faculty and staff as they <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org/blog/">blog</a> about their experiences. The first two, pilot years of the Praxis Program were supported by a generous grant from the Mellon Foundation to UVa Library's <a href="http://uvasci.org/">Scholarly Communication Institute</a>, which also allowed the Scholars' Lab to create a broader <a href="http://praxis-network.org/">Praxis Network</a>, in collaboration with six other universities in three countries.
