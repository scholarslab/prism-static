      <h1>Prism</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Prism was a project for crowdsourced text analysis developed by the <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">Praxis Program</a> at the <a href="http://scholarslab.org/">Scholars' Lab</a>, a center for experimental digital research at the University of Virginia Library. After years of significant use, particularly by K-12 educators, as of summer of 2020 <b>Prism is no longer available as a usable tool</b>. This site is meant to document the intervention it made, and it primarily presents archival versions of the writings that accompanied the tool on its site. </p>
      
      <p>Prism was released under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY 3.0</a> license. The materials below were largely drawn from the original Prism site, though they have been lightly updated and edited based on recent activities (mostly verb tense). After a short description of different ways to run similar activities in the classroom, the subsequent sections each describe particular pages from the original Prism site, all originally published in 2013 with small changes over the years.

      <h2>Pedagogical Alternatives to Prism</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>While the tool was envisioned originally to be used for research into crowdsourced interpretation, it saw significantly more use by K-12 teachers. This user group used the tool to track understanding and language literacy, asking users, for example, to mark passages they did or did not understand. Another example from second language learning asked readers to mark verb tenses in use throughout a passage, offering at a glance a sense of what areas needed to be reinforced for students. Given the heavy classroom use of Prism, we wanted to offer a few alternative ideas for related tools and activities that teachers might use instead.</p>
      
      <p>If you are still intrigued by Prism, you might explore the original <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/crowdsourcing-interpretation/">transparency game</a> that Prism was based upon. The idea is pretty simple. You need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A set of transparencies</li>
        <li>A set of dry erase markers</li>
        <li>A short passage printed out with several copies</li>
        <li>An interpretive prompt</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>As we played it while preparing for Prism, each person gets a copy of the text, a transparency, and three colored dry erase markers (we went with red, green, and blue). It's important that every person have the same colors for the exercise to be meaningful. The interpretive prompt needs some constraint to be meaningful, and, again, we chose to assign single words to particular colors. At the start of a timer, each person is asked to place the transparency over their text, read it, and highlight words and passages based on their connections to the highlighter colors/categories. At the end, you collect the transparencies, stack them, and discuss the ways the colors do or do not overlap. </p>

      <p>This transparency game, of course, requires in-person instruction. You could approximate some version of the effect by adopting a think-pair-share format. I would start by asking students to highlight a text individually and then, in breakout rooms, pair students off to compare their highlights. From there, the group can reconstitute itself for larger discussion. You won't exactly replicate the effect of visualizing overlapping interpretations, but, then again, the visualization was always meant to be a metaphor for–and in the serve of–discussion more generally. If you are interested in text analysis writ large, <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant</a> remains a user-friendly online alternative (with far more functionality). And <a href="https://nowcomment.com/">Now Comment</a> is a good alternative for generating class discussion more generally in an online environment.</p>

<h2>Page 1: About Prism</h2><hr>
<p>Published around 2013, the text of the Prism about page conveyed the intervention it tried to make. </p>
<p>Prism was a tool for "crowdsourcing interpretation." Users were invited to provide an interpretation of a text by highlighting words according to different categories,  or "facets."  Each individual interpretation then contributed to the generation of a visualization which demonstrated the combined interpretation of all the users. The team envisioned Prism as a tool for both pedagogical use and scholarly exploration, revealing patterns that exist in the subjective experience of reading a text. </p>
<p>The concept emerged from a decade-long conversation on categories of textual interpretation which took place at the University of Virginia, and specifically from <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/crowdsourcing-interpretation/">transparency mark-up games</a> played by UVa Media Studies students and at <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/SpecLab.html?id=VPXCk396uPYC">SpecLab</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>the original game involved shared, Xeroxed page images, transparent overlays, dry-erase markers, a common interpretive prompt, and a moment in which  somebody yelled ‘Stop!’ and the transparencies were stacked up for discussion. (Nowviskie)
</p></blockquote>
<p>At SpecLab, Jerome McGann and Johanna Drucker <a href="http://nora.lis.uiuc.edu:3030/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&amp;chunk.id=ss1-3-4&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ss1-3-4">further  developed the concept</a>, which became known as the "Patacritical Demon" — the best bit of vaporware (not) to emerge from UVa at the turn of the century.</p>
<p>The Scholars' Lab offered these un-realized concepts as inspiration for the first project to be undertaken by graduate student fellows of the <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">Praxis Program</a> in its inaugural year. The task of <a href="https://scholarslab.github.io/prism-static/pages/alumni">the 2011-2012 team</a> of students was to determine how to translate the physical exercise  of marking a text into a digital one. They chose to employ a constrained interpretive vocabulary and to limit the length of the text in order to stay true to the transparency game. Like the transparency exercise, the end goal of Prism was to produce <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&amp;chunk.id=ss1-4-10">aesthetic provocations</a>, that is, visualizations which provoke further discussion.  </p>
<p>The 2012-2013 cohort of Praxis fellows (listed below) retained the vision set by the original team.  Their goal was to expand Prism to a format that would promote classroom use and scholarly conversation.  This led them to define two primary objectives.   The first was the ability for users to upload their own texts and to define their own interpretive categories.   The second was to create a more inviting and user-friendly environment that would encourage participation and exploration.  To that end, they redesigned the website, paying special attention to workflow, ease of use, and aesthetic concerns.   In addition, both the simple visualization feature and highlighting function were refined, in hope that Prism can now be more easily employed by the user for a variety of interpretive projects.  </p>
<p>Some potential uses for Prism can be found collected in the <a href="http://pedagogy-toolkit.org/tools/PRISM.html"> Pedagogy Toolkit for English</a>. In addition, the Praxis team wrote a lengthier theorization of the tool for <a href="https://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/3/379">Linguistic and Literary Computing</a>.</p>

  <h2>Page 2: Prism Front Page</h2>
<hr>
<img src="front-page.jpeg" class="gallery-images">
<p>The front page of Prism was designed to be playful and inviting. Users could upload their own Prism documents or participate in highlighting documents that already existed. At the time Prism was retired, there tens of thousands of distinct Prism documents uploaded. The handful of first documents - "The Raven," "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man", "The Sneetches," and "Notes on the State of Virginia" - had markings from between 80 and 800 users. </p>
<h2>Page 3: Prism Highlight Page</h2>
<hr>
<img src="highlight.jpeg" class="gallery-images">
<p>The highlight page was the main point of entry for interacting with a text through Prism. After uploading a document, a user was asked to mark their interpretation along particular categories. The cursor and interface mimicked the act of highlighting the documents like you would in the original transparency game. </p>
<h2>Page 4: Prism Visualization Page Part 1</h2>
<hr>
<img src="winning-facet-viz.jpeg" class="gallery-images">
The visualization page offered two options.
The tool collected all the markings of each person who had played with the document to offer two visualizations. The "Winning Facet Visualization" used Google Charts API to show, at a glance, which interpretation was marked more heavily for a particular word. 
<h2>Page 4: Prism Visualization Page Part 2</h2>
<hr>
<img src="font-size-viz.jpeg" class="gallery-images">
The "Font Size Visualization" offered users the chance to see, within a particular category, which words were marked most frequently. Whereas "Winning Facet Visualization" could, for example, show which words were marked realism vs modernism, the "Font Size Visualization" could show which words were the <i>most</i> modernist, at least according to the readers. 

<h2>Page 5: Original Demo Video</h2>

<p>This video, originally used as a tutorial for the tool, gives a sense of how the tool was meant to function.</p>

<h2>Page 6: Planned Future Directions at Completion of Development in 2013</h2> 
<hr>
<h2>Thinking About Texts</h2>
<p>Although the 2012-2013 cohort eventually chose to focus our efforts on expanding the word-based capabilities of Prism, we had many discussions throughout year about expanding our conception of “texts” to include more than the written word.   Could Prism be used to generate collaborative readings of photographs, maps, musical scores, or audio clips?   In response to this question, we came up with a number of ideas. Here, we have chosen to share some of those possibilities.</p> 

<h2>Interpreting Photographs</h2>
<p>There already exist a number of promising image-based web applications.   Projects such as <a href="http://www.snapshotserengeti.org/">Snapshot Serengeti</a> use crowd sourcing to complete scholarly and research based projects.  Others, such as <a href="http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/imageplot.html">ImagePlot</a>, identify macro patterns through a series of images.  In addition, there are a number of applications which allow you to annotate images as an individual and perhaps view other annotations of the same document (e.g. <a href="http://mith.umd.edu/tile/">Tile</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190829101152/http://tapor.uvic.ca/~mholmes/image_markup/index.php">Uvic</a>, and <a href="http://a.nnotate.com/">A.nnotate</a>).  However, most of these applications don’t allow you to overlay multiple annotations in order to generate a collaborative interpretation. That’s where Prism could come in.</p>

<p>As a test case, we tried using the transparency game on an image.  Drawing on her own research interests, Cecilia presented us with the following image.  In a manner similar to the transparency game, we were then asked to highlight areas of the image that we identified as “southern.”  The exercise resulted in some surprising results.  In addition to highlighting the "colored" sign that was emblematic of the Jim Crow South, most readers also highlighted the boy's body.  It is striking that they would see blackness, or this black boy, as representative of the South.  One could argue that this is because of the proliferation of photographic images during the Workers Progress Administration that highlighted black, southern poverty.</p>

  <figcaption>Jim Crow Drinking Fountain, county courthouse lawn. Halifax, North Carolina, 1938.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>How can this exercise be executed in a digital format?  There are two basic problems.  How will users be able to interact with the image and how will the resulting data then be aggregated and visualized?  We discussed several options for highlighting images, but there are two which seem to hold the most promise.  First, the image could be divided up into various sections which the users can “tag” with various categories, much like the tagging feature on facebook.  To visualize the collaborative interpretation, we could then display the “winning” category for each section, much like the current option to display the winning facet for each word in Prism.  Secondly, users could be given a paintbrush tool which would allow them to highlight whichever elements on the page they see fit.  In that case, we could visualize the resulting interpretation through a heat map layered over the photograph.  Those portions that receive the most markings would turn red and the least blue, for example. </p>

<h2>Word-based Texts: Additional Possibilites</h2> 
<p>In addition, there are a number of ways in which Prism might expand its ability to work with written texts.  The first is to offer additional ways to visualize the collaborative interpretations.  Below are a number of sketches from the 2011-2012 Praxis team.  You can see that we have realized some of these ideas in this edition of Prism.  Users can now view a pie chart which presents the percentage of users who highlighted for each facet under the “winning color” visualization option.  In addition, provocative visualizations could draw upon existing web applications that use text mining, such as the word clouds generated through applications like <a href="http://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant</a>.</p>
<p>Other possibilities for Prism include expanding the way in which Prism creates collaborative interpretations by relying on computational linguistic analysis.  Specifically, this would allow for a more open-ended interpretation process.  Imagine if users were free to apply any description they see fit to a passage of text or a particular word (similar to the capabilities offered by <a href="http://nowcomment.com/">NowComment</a>).   Prism would then process these comments through topic modeling (e.g. <a href="http://www.matthewjockers.net/">Jockers’ work</a>) to visualize the most common words invoked by users.  In addition, this process could be paired with a thesaurus in order to computationally identify synonyms, allowing for a more synthesized collaborative interpretation based on open-ended commentary from users.</p>
